# Clustering-Methods-For-Unsupervised-Data
In this project, our goal is to explore various clustering techniques and identify the most suitable method for the given dataset. We implemented K-Means, MiniBatchKMeans, MeanShift, AffinityPropagation, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN, and evaluated their performance using silhouette, Calinski Harabasz, and Davies Bouldin scores.
